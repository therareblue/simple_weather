# simple_weather
This is a simple script to obtain and show current weather for any town.

The script runs in the console, asking for a "town name" (or "x" for exit).

Requirements:<br>
You need to make a free account in openweathermap.org website, to obtain an API key.<br>
The key then is used in the requests of the "weather" and "air quality" apps used in this script.

To make the script running, you simply replace the app_id = "your_app_id" line, placing your API key.
