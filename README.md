# simple_weather
This is a simple script to obtain and show current weather for any town.

The script runs in the console, asking for a "town name" (or "x" for exit).

<b>Requirements:</b><br>
You need to make a free account in openweathermap.org website, to obtain an API key.<br>
The key then is used in the requests of the "weather" and "air quality" apps used in this script.

To make the script running, you simply replace the <b>app_id = "your_app_id"</b> line, placing your API key.

<i>Please Note:
The script is written really fast and dirty, while I try to add a weather and forecast functionality of my Workshop Assistant.<br>
It will ve revised and clarified with the next updates.</i>
